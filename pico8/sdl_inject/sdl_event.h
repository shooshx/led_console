    /* This is necessary for ABI compatibility between Visual C++ and GCC.
       Visual C++ will respect the push pack pragma and use 52 bytes (size of
       SDL_TextEditingEvent, the largest structure for 32-bit and 64-bit
       architectures) for this union, and GCC will use the alignment of the
       largest datatype within the union, which is 8 bytes on 64-bit
       architectures.
       So... we'll add padding to force the size to be 56 bytes for both.
       On architectures where pointers are 16 bytes, this needs rounding up to
       the next multiple of 16, 64, and on architectures where pointers are
       even larger the size of SDL_UserEvent will dominate as being 3 pointers.
